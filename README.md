# generator
This is a generator. A generator is code which generates buildings (or parts of buildings). More specifically, a generator is a function which takes in and returns a `Model`. 

By managing your generator as code, you can take advantage of all the great tools for code collaboration and deployment offered by GitHub. Like any good repo, your generator should have a great `README.md`(like this one) which acts as the documentation for your generator. If you look below, you'll see that this `README.md` explains the generator's inputs and outputs, and has a short description of what kind of output your generator creates. Over time we're going to automate the creation of a preview image, like the one you see below, which'll give you a good idea of what you should expect to see from a generator.

Generators are just code, so you're free to compile and run them wherever they're compatible. This generator is a .Net Standard 2.0 library written in C# which means you can use it in a Revit addin, a Unity app, or as a "zero touch" library in Dynamo. But if you really want to put your generator to work, you can publish it to run on the Hypar platform, making it globally available and executable via Hypar's API. You can see this generator running [here](https://hypar.io/functions/hypar-dotnet-starter).

### Inputs
- Height - The height of the object.
  - Min: 1.0
  - Max: 10.0
  - Step: 1.0
- Location - The location of the object on the planet Earth.

### Outputs
- Area - The area of the mass.

## Getting Started with Hypar
This section is a deeper dive into how to get started with Hypar. If you clone this repo to get started building your own generator, then you can remove this section when you edit this `README.md`.

- Go to https://www.hypar.io/ and sign up. **A login is only required when publishing your function to the world!**
- Install [.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/)
- Install the Hypar CLI:
  - Download for:
    - [Windows](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hypar-cli/hypar-win-x64.zip)
    - [Mac](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hypar-cli/hypar-osx.10.12-x64.zip)
    - [Linux](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hypar-cli/hypar-linux-x64.zip)
      - Linux requires that additional dependencies be installed to support .net. Those can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites?tabs=netcore21#linux-distribution-dependencies).
  - Link
    - On Mac and Linux: `ln -s <path to hypar executable> /usr/local/bin/hypar`
    - On windows add `<path to hypar>` to your user `PATH`.
- Install an IDE. Here's a couple of options:
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's a free IDE with great support for .net and python and it looks and acts the same on every platform (Mac, Linux, Windows), so it makes our job of supporting you slightly easier.
  - [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is great too, but it doesn't exist for Linux and is still learning to walk on the Mac.
- Clone this repo.  
```git clone https://github.com/hypar-io/starter```. 
- `cd starter`
- Edit the `hypar.json` file to describe your function.
- `hypar generate ./src` to build the `Input` and `Output` classes into the `src` directory.
- `dotnet build`
- Use the Hypar CLI to publish your function.
```
cd <function directory>
hypar publish
```
- Preview `.glb` models generated by Hypar locally using the [glTF Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/gltf-vscode), or [Don McCurdy's online glTF Viewer](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/).

## Testing
```
cd test
dotnet test
```
